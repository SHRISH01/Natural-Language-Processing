Thank you so much Udacity for providing such quality content. \n\nLDA is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions. \n\n* Each document is modeled as a multinomial distribution of topics and each topic is modeled as a multinomial distribution of words.\n* LDA assumes that the every chunk of text we feed into it will contain words that are somehow related. Therefore choosing the right corpus of data is crucial. \n* It also assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution.
